# DataSorterProject

## Description
This is a Java console-based project that implements multiple sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort) to compare their performance and demonstrate the impact of algorithmic complexity on execution time.  
It provides a menu-driven interface for users to enter numbers manually or generate random datasets automatically.

## Features
- Enter custom numbers manually.
- Generate random numbers automatically.
- Perform Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
- Measure execution time and number of operations (steps) for each algorithm.
- Compare all algorithms in a results table.
- Simple user-friendly menu interface with input validation.

## Usage
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open the project in **Eclipse**.
3. Run the `datasorter.DataSorter` class.
4. Follow the menu options to test sorting algorithms.

## Team Simulation
Since this assignment is done individually, I simulated team collaboration by creating separate Git branches for:
- Member 1: Bubble Sort
- Member 2: Merge Sort
- Member 3: Quick Sort
- Member 4: Integration & UI

All branches were merged into the `main` branch for final submission.
